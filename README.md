The code you provided is a Python script that uses the `requests` library to retrieve the public IP address and location information based on that IP address.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `get_ip()` function makes a GET request to 'https://api64.ipify.org?format=json' to retrieve the public IP address. It uses the `requests.get()` method and converts the response to JSON format. The IP address is extracted from the JSON response and returned.

2. The `get_location()` function calls the `get_ip()` function to obtain the IP address. It then makes a GET request to 'https://ipapi.co/{ip_address}/json/' using an f-string to insert the obtained IP address. The response is converted to JSON format.

3. The relevant location information, including the IP address, city, region, and country, is extracted from the JSON response and stored in the `location_data` dictionary.

4. Finally, the `get_location()` function is called, and the resulting location data is printed.

Please note that this script relies on external APIs ('https://api64.ipify.org' and 'https://ipapi.co/') to retrieve the IP address and location information.
